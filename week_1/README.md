# 📘 Quantum Computation – Initial Reading Guide

Welcome to the start of your quantum computation journey! This guide outlines the initial reading goals and provides optional supplementary materials to build a strong conceptual foundation.

---

## 🎯 **Primary Reading Target**

You should aim to **complete Chapter 1 and Chapter 2** of:

**Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang**

[*Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* (2000)](https://profmcruz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information-nielsen-chuang.pdf)
📖 Commonly referred to as "Mike and Ike", this is the definitive textbook in the field.

These chapters will cover:

- The basic postulates of quantum mechanics as applied to computation  
- Qubits, quantum gates, and quantum circuits  
- The Dirac notation and quantum states  
- Basic quantum algorithms and measurements

## 📚 **Optional Reading Materials (Highly Recommended for Deeper Understanding)**

1. ### 🧠 John Preskill’s Introductory Notes  
   [📄 Chapter 1 – Introduction to Quantum Computation](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/notes/chap1.pdf)  
   From his legendary Caltech course (Ph229), Preskill provides a concise yet intuitive introduction with a physicist’s perspective.

2. ### 🌐 Interactive Essay by Nielsen & Matuschak  
   [💡 Quantum Computing for the Very Curious](https://quantum.country/qcvc)  
   An innovative online essay using spaced repetition and rich explanations to help ideas stick. Perfect for developing long-term intuition.

3. ### 📝 UC Berkeley’s QIC Course Notes  
   [📘 Chapters 1 & 2 Notes from CS191 (Fall 2010)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs191/fa10/notes/chap1&2.pdf)  
   These notes complement Nielsen and Chuang with clarity and an algorithmic perspective, helpful if you're coming from a computer science background.

## 🧭 Suggested Strategy

- **Start with Nielsen & Chuang.** Don’t worry if some parts feel dense—just keep moving forward. Understanding will build with repetition.
- **Use the optional readings** to reinforce your understanding:
  - Preskill if you're physics-oriented,
  - Berkeley notes if you're CS/math-oriented,
