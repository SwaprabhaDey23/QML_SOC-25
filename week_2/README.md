# 🧪 Week 2: Getting Started with Qiskit

Welcome to Week 2 of your quantum computing journey! 🚀  
This week marks your transition from learning the **theory** of quantum computing to actually **programming quantum circuits** using **Qiskit**, IBM’s open-source quantum software platform.

---
## 🎯 This Week’s Goals

> ✅ **Install Qiskit and run your first quantum programs**  
> ✅ **Learn how quantum circuits are constructed and simulated**  
> ✅ **Bridge theory and practice by studying quantum circuits in Nielsen & Chuang**

---
### 📖 Nielsen & Chuang — Chapter 4 (Sections 4.1 to 4.4)

To understand what you're programming, you need to know how quantum circuits work under the hood.  
**Read Sections 4.1 to 4.4**, which cover:
- The quantum circuit model
- Single- and two-qubit gates
- Circuit diagrams
- Universality and basic decomposition

This reading will help you understand what Qiskit is actually doing when you define a circuit in code.
