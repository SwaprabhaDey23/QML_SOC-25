# ⚙️ Week 4: Quantum Algorithms

Welcome to **Week 4**, where we begin exploring the powerful world of **quantum algorithms**! 🧠⚛️  
These are the tools that make quantum computers *truly different* from classical ones — solving certain problems exponentially faster.

This week, you'll study three of the most iconic quantum algorithms: **Deutsch-Jozsa**, **Shor’s algorithm**, and **Grover’s search** — and learn how to implement them using **Qiskit**.
