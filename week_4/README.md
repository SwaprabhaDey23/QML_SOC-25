# 🧮 Week 6: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)

Welcome to **Week 6**, where we explore one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computing: **Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)**. These hybrid algorithms combine classical optimization with quantum circuits — and are particularly powerful on today’s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.

This week, your goal is to understand VQAs, with a focus on the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)**, and **implement it for the Minimum Vertex Cover problem**. 🧠⚛️
