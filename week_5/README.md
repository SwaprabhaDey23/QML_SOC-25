# 🧪 Week 7: Implement a Quantum Research Paper

This week is about taking the leap from learner to explorer. You’ll pick a **real research paper** in quantum computing, understand its core idea, and try to **implement or simulate** part of it using Qiskit (or another framework).

---

## 🎯 Your Task

Find a **recent research paper** that interests you — ideally related to quantum algorithms, optimization, or simulation. Try to **implement the algorithm or method described**, even if it's a simplified version on a small problem instance.

The focus is on:
- Understanding the problem being solved
- Reproducing the quantum algorithm or core circuit
- Running small-scale tests (3–5 qubits is fine)
- Documenting your implementation and insights

## A few suggested paper which you can try

If you're unsure what to pick, you can **start by trying one of the following**:

1. **[Quantum Convolutional Neural Network in ANNNI model (Phys. Rev. B)]**  
   🔗 https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.L081105

2. **[Learning quantum dynamics incoherently]**  
   🔗 https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12834

3. **[Generative quantum eigensolver]**  
   🔗 https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09253

You can also adapt ideas from these papers to smaller examples if full reproduction is too complex.

## ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Select a research paper (or use one of the examples above)  
- [ ] Understand the problem, method, and results  
- [ ] Implement the algorithm using Qiskit or PennyLane  
- [ ] Run and test on a small case (e.g., 3–5 qubits)  
- [ ] Document your work and note any assumptions/simplifications

## 💡 Tip

Focus on the **core idea**, not full-scale reproduction. Even implementing a simplified version of a complex paper is incredibly valuable.
